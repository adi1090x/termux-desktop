Alright, Lets just get this straight, these are just some **dotfiles** & **scripts**, which will help you to setup a graphical environment in **termux**. I've tried to make it *as easy as possible* to setup a beautiful ***linux desktop on your android device*** with termux, So follow the steps and you'll end up making it look like this -

Lets start from the beginning...

## About Termux

Termux is an *Android terminal emulator* and **Linux environment** app that works directly with **no rooting** or setup required. A minimal base system is installed automatically - additional packages are available using the *PKG/APT package manager*. More [Here](https://termux.com/)...

## Termux Installation

You can install termux form google play store or from f-droid.

- Get it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)
- Download from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/)

More information about installation is [here](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page)

## Preparation

Install `Termux` & `Termux:API` on your phone. It's recommended to install *Termux API* application as many desktop elements are dependent on it.

> This setup is created and tested on :
>
> Device - **Redmi Note 9 Pro**
> Android - **Android 10 (Q)**
> CPU Type - **aarch64**

## Installation

After installing both applications above, open `Termux` and follow the steps below -

- Update termux packages and install `git`

```bash
pkg upgrade && pkg install git
```

- Clone this repository

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/adi1090x/termux-desktop.git
```

> **Warning** : I'm assuming that you're doing this on a fresh termux install. If not, I'll suggest you to do so. However the `setup.sh` script backup every file it replace, It's still recommended that you manually backup your files in order to avoid conflicts.

- Change to cloned directory and run `setup.sh` with *--install* option

```bash
cd termux-desktop
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh --install
```

> If script `setup.sh` fails during package installation (due to network issues), you can re-execute it again.

- During installation, you'll be asked to set up password for **VNC** -

```bash
[*] Setting up VNC Server...

You will require a password to access your desktops.

Password:
Verify:
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n
```

> Note that passwords are not visible when you are typing them and minimum password length is 6 characters.
> Remember the password you typed as it'll be required to connect via vnc client.

- If everything is okay, you will see this message -

```bash
New 'localhost:1 ()' desktop is localhost:1

Creating default startup script /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.vnc/xstartup
Creating default config /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.vnc/config
Starting applications specified in /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.vnc/xstartup
Log file is /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.vnc/localhost:1.log

[*] Server Is Running...

TigerVNC server sessions:

X DISPLAY #     PROCESS ID
:1              XXXXX
```

> It means that X (vnc) server is available on display 'localhost:1'.

That's it. `Termux Desktop` is installed successfully. *Restart Termux* and enter `startdesktop` command to start *vncserver* and connect via VNC Client.

```bash
startdesktop

[*] Starting VNC Server...

New 'localhost:1 ()' desktop is localhost:1

Starting applications specified in /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.vnc/xstartup
Log file is /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.vnc/localhost:1.log
```

## Uninstallation

If you ever want to uninstall Termux Desktop, just run `setup.sh` with *--uninstall* option. Just keep the `setup.sh` script and delete the cloned repository to save space. I'll create a separate uninstaller script later. The command below will remove all the packages and delete all the config files it installed, including the changes you've made. So, Be careful there...

```bash
./setup.sh --uninstall
```

***VNC Client***

Now you need a VNC client app to connect to server. I'm using this Android VNC client: [VNC Viewer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.realvnc.viewer.android). You can use [TigerVNC](https://tigervnc.org/) if you're trying to connect to server by a computer (Windows or Linux).

Determine port number on which VNC server listens. It can be calculated like this: 5900 + {display number}. So for display 'localhost:1' the port will be 5901.

Now open the VNC Viewer application and create a new connection with the following information (assuming that port is 5901) -

```bash
Address:
127.0.0.1:5901

Name:
Termux
```

Now launch it. You will be prompted for `password` that you entered during installation. After entering password, you'll be headed directly to this desktop -
