Alright, Lets's get this straight, these are just some **dotfiles**, which will help you to setup a graphical environment in **termux**. It's kind of a *backup* for me as well. <br />

This repo contains config files, some useful & important scripts. I'm trying to make it a *step by step guide* to setup a beautiful ***linux desktop in your android device*** with termux, So follow the steps and you'll end up making it look like this - <br />

![desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adi1090x/termux-desktop/master/previews/preview_13.png) <br />

Lets's start with the beginning... <br />

## What is termux?

Termux is an *Android terminal emulator* and **Linux environment** app that works directly with **no rooting** or setup required. A minimal base system is installed automatically - additional packages are available using the *APT package manager*. More [Here](https://termux.com/)... <br />

## How To install termux?

You can install termux form google play store or from f-droid. <br />

Get it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux) <br />

```
## Configuration

Now all the necessary programs are installed, it's time to configure the system. <br />
So, first clone this repo by,
```
cd $HOME && git clone https://github.com/adi1090x/termux-desktop
```
Now go to the cloned directory *termux-desktop* and copy or move **'home' & 'usr'** directories to ***/data/data/com.termux/files***. you can do it by,
```
cp -rf ./home /data/data/com.termux/files && cp -rf ./usr /data/data/com.termux/files
```
or
```
mv -f ./home /data/data/com.termux/files && mv -f ./home /data/data/com.termux/files

```
**Warning** : I'm assuming you're doing this on a fresh termux install. If not so, please backup your files before running these command above. These commands will forcefully copy or move files in *home* & *usr* directory. So, before doing that, take a look inside the repo directories, and backup your existing config files (like .vimrc, .zshrc, .gitconfig, etc). <br />

***VNC Server***
Now, Let's configure the **vnc server** for graphical output. Run -
```
vncserver -localhost
```
At first time, you will be prompted for setting up passwords -
```
You will require a password to access your desktops.

Password:
Verify:
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n
```
Note that passwords are not visible when you are typing them and maximal password length is 8 characters. <br />
If everything is okay, you will see this message -
```
New 'localhost:1 ()' desktop is localhost:1

Creating default startup script /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.vnc/xstartup
Creating default config /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.vnc/config
Starting applications specified in /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.vnc/xstartup
Log file is /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.vnc/localhost:1.log
```
It means that X (vnc) server is available on display 'localhost:1'. <br />
Finally, to make programs do graphical output to the display 'localhost:1', set environment variable like shown here (yes, without specifying 'localhost'):
```
export DISPLAY=":1"
```
You may even put this variable to your bashrc or profile so you don't have to always set it manually unless display address will be changed. <br />

Now You can start the vnc server by,
```
vncserver
```
And to stop the server, run -
```
vncserver -kill :1
```

***VNC Client***
Now you need a vnc client app to connect to server. I'm using this Android VNC client: [VNC Viewer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.realvnc.viewer.android) (developed by RealVNC Limited). You can use [TigerVNC](https://tigervnc.org/) if you're trying to connect to server by a computer (Windows or Linux).

Determine port number on which VNC server listens. It can be calculated like this: 5900 + {display number}. So for display 'localhost:1' the port will be 5901. <br />

Now open the VNC Viewer application and create a new connection with the following information (assuming that VNC port is 5901) - <br />
```
Address:
127.0.0.1:5901

Name:
Termux
```
Now launch it. You will be prompted for password that you entered on first launch of 'vncserver'. And because you've copy pasted everthing, you'll be headed to this desktop - <br />
